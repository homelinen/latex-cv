% Dear {Employer},

% Why I'm applying

% Why I want to work here

Amazon's products and solutions make it much easier to develop web applications,
which are definitely the future due to their accessibility and portability,
while using these tools to provide their own useful and intuitive solutions. 
I always work hard and it always pleases me to solve a solution in the best
possible way.  Developing and creating interesting solutions to real world
problems is why I became interested in software development.

% Why I want the role

My first foray into programming was with PHP, which I used for hacking and
maintaining my Wordpress blog. From PHP I have learned Java, Python and most
recently Ruby. Programming has always interested me as it is an application of
problem solving, finding the right solution for a job and evaluating that
solution has always been one of my strengths, through high school and
university.

At university I have learned the basics of software development through courses
like Data Structures and Algorithms and Software Design. The main programming
language for my course is Java so I am well acquainted with Object Orientated
design and develop most of my own software using the OOP approach.

Over the past few months I have taken the time to learn Ruby on Rails. To help
me learn I started to build a photo gallery for my personal website and I am
continuing to learn RoR through my third year group project at university.

% Elevator pitch  

I have a great passion for software development and I always enjoy making and
testing software, in my own time and through my university coursework. There's
always a new languages, approach or library to try out and I find this to be one
of the most exciting aspects of development.

As well as software development, I have always been interested in Linux System
Administration. In my spare time I manage a collection of Debian and Arch Linux
based servers for web hosting, primarily for my own websites and services.

Yours sincerely,
