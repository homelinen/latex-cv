Dear Neivetha Thiruchvelum,

% 1. Why you're applying and a status overview

Rails Drive is a new and innovative company, and I believe that your company will be able
to thrive and provide some truly amazing products that always fulfill and even exceed
the clients needs.

% 2. Why you want to work for the company

Through University I have a strong Object Orientated Programming background and
believe that this knowledge translates very nicely into the Model View
Controller methodology of Ruby on Rails.

% 3. Why you want to pursue this particular role

As an amateur photographer I require a portfolio, so I developed my portfolio in
Ruby on Rails as it is a very powerful tool and greatly sped up development time
for myself. Through this small project I believe I have gained the necessary
skills to start learning and developing full scale web applications.

I have hosted all of my own websites and applications for the past 2 years and
am very familiar with the setup and configuration of Linux servers for use as
web and MySQL servers.

System administration is a hobby of mine and I have learned a lot from some very
experienced Lunux Sys Admins at the Falkirk Linux Users Group. My Sys Admin
skills are essential as they can be used for rolling out client software and
maintaining all of the development servers required for running a small
business.
