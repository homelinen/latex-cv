Dear Ms Neivetha Thiruchelvam,

% Why I'm applying
I am writing to apply for the advertised position of \textbf{Software
Engineer} at your startup, Rails Drive.

% Why I want to work here
Although Rails Drive is a new company, I can imagine that you are passionate
about developing inspiring web applications and providing great service to your
customers.

% Why I want the role
Ruby on Rails enamoured me from the moment I first used it and it
constantly surprises me in the innovative approaches that it takes. The role of Software Engineer at your company would
not only help me hone my skills with RoR, but apply what I've learned from
developing my own RoR applications with an innovative and creative company.

Software Engineering is the art of applying development principles to all
aspects of software production. Ensuring that at all stages best practices are
used and that the future development of the software is as simple and painless
as possible. I have worked in several 2-3 man teams, for university assignments and for
2D/3D games in time restricted competitions. I have used the git version control
system in all of my collaborative projects and managed tasks between
participants in agile methods, such as Scrum.

% Elevator pitch
As a university student I am always researching new technologies and
approaches to software engineering. In my courses I have learned a lot about
measuring the performance and fitness of algorithms and other code quality
measurements and procedures, such as Unit Testing.
Discussing technology and software is one of my passions and I am always
enthused to discuss my interests and what I am working on with other people.

My personal interest in Linux system administration is of great benefit to your
company as I have configured several Debian based Linux systems for use
as web servers and development systems.
I currently host my own website and several RoR applications on an Arch Linux
VPS that I configured and maintain.

Yours sincerely,
