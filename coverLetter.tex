Dear Ms Neivetha Thiruchelvam,

% Why I'm applying
I am writing to apply for the advertised position of \textbf{Software Engineer}
at your startup, Rails Drive.

% Why I want to work here
Although Rails Drive is a new company, I can imagine that you are passionate
about developing inspiring web applications and providing great service to your
customers. 

% Why I want the role
Ruby on Rails enamoured me from the moment I first used it and it constantly
surprises me in the innovative approaches that it takes. The role of Software
Engineer at your company would not only help me hone my skills with RoR, but
apply what I've learned from developing my own RoR applications with an
innovative and creative company.

Software Engineering is the art of applying development principles to all
aspects of software production. Ensuring that at all stages best practices are
used and that the future development of the software is as simple and painless
as possible. I have worked in several 2-3 man teams, for university assignments
and for 2D/3D games in time restricted competitions. I have used the git version
control system in all of my collaborative projects and managed tasks between
participants in agile methods, such as Scrum.

% Elevator pitch
As a university student I am always researching new technologies and approaches
to software development. In my courses I have learned a lot about measuring the
performance and fitness of algorithms and other code quality measurements and
procedures, such as Unit Testing.  Discussing technology and software is one of
my passions and I am always enthused to discuss my interests and what I am
working on with other people.

As well as software development, I have always been interested in Linux System
Administration. In my spare time I manage a collection of Debian and Arch Linux
based servers for web hosting, primarily for my own website. Building and
configuring servers is another aspect of the this role that I could fulfill, as
working development services and deployment strategies greatly benefit group
workflow.

Yours sincerely,
