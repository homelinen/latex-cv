% Dear {Employer},

% Why I'm applying



% Why I want to work here

Amazon's products and solutions make it much easier to develop web applications,
which are definitely the future due to their accesibility and portability, while
using these tools to provide their own useful and intuitive solutions. 

% Why I want the role

My first foray into programming was with PHP, which I used for hacking and
maintaining my Wordpress blog. From PHP I have learned Java, Python and most
recently Ruby. Development has always interested me as it is an application of
problem solving, finding the right solution for a job and evaluating that
solution has always been one of my strengths, mainly through Physics and
Mathematics at high school.

Ruby on Rails really grabbed my attention once I started to use it. I found it
filled with elegant solutions and it removed all the barriers I thought you had to
jump to develop a web application. I learned RoR by starting to build a gallery
application for my personal website. I am continuing to learn RoR through my
university group project that lasts until April.

% Elevator pitch  

As a university student I am always researching new technologies and approaches
to software development. Through university I have learned a variety of code
quality measures and testing procedures, such as Cyclomatic Complexity
calculations and JUnit.

As well as software development, I have always been interested in Linux System
Administration. In my spare time I manage a collection of Debian and Arch Linux
based servers for web hosting, primarily for my own websites and services.

Yours sincerely,
