% Dear {Employer},

% Why I'm applying

% Why I want to work here

Web applications are growing in popularity every year. With mobile devices such
as tablets and mobile phones becoming more and more web centric, it only makes
sense to create more powerful and more useful applciations. I believe that
Amazon is the company to do this. With powerful backend solutions like Amazon
EC2 services can be rolled out and served to thousands of customers worldwide,
with relative ease.

% Why I want the role

My first foray into programming was with PHP, which I used for hacking and
maintaing my Wordpress blog. From PHP I have learned Java, Python and most
recently Ruby. Development has always interested me as it is an application of
problem solving, finding the right solution for a job and evulating that
solution has always been one of my strengths, mainly through Physics and
Mathematics at high school.

% Elevator pitch  

As a university student I am always researching new technologies and approaches
to software development. Through university I have learned a variety of code
quality measures and testing procedures, such as Cyclomatic Complexity
calculations and JUnit.

As well as software development, I have always been interested in Linux System
Administration. In my spare time I manage a collection of Debian and Arch Linux
based servers for web hosting, primarily for my own websites and services.

Yours sincerely,
