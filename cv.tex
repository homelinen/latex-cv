\section*{Education}

\begin{itemize}
  \item BSc Computer Science at Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, 2014.

    Received two Certificates of Merit. Currently on track to receive a first class degree.

    Three courses of note:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Database Management Systems (DBMS)} \\
            Design and implementation of a database for farmers to keep track of their livestock and income.
            Entity Relationship diagrams were used to design the table layout and MySQL was used as the DBMS.
        \item \textbf{Interaction Design} \\
            Created and designed a web application prototype as a group for tracking a students courses and grades. 
            The practical aspect of the course required a pitch for the product as well as user testing, with appropriate
            surveys taken during the testing stage.
        \item \textbf{Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)} \\
            DSA was an introduction to a variety of searching and sorting algorithms, such as Quicksort and Binary Search and how they can be compared.
            This involved deriving the complexity of different algorithms and actually implementing some of
            the algorithms in coursework.
